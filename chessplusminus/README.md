The software C+- is a chess application designed for desktop platforms. It is intended to provide users with an immersive and customizable chess-playing experience. The application features standard chess gameplay along with unique custom rules, including a dynamic move count system where each player gains an extra move each turn compared to their opponent until a check occurs, resetting the move count for the opposing player. Additionally, the application offers features such as highlighting possible moves, checking for check and checkmate, handling pawn promotion, capturing pieces, offering and accepting draws, displaying game results, and optional functionalities like move animation, sound effects, clock timer, undo moves, move recording, and displaying captured pieces. Through a user-friendly interface, C+- aims to engage players of all skill levels in challenging and enjoyable chess matches.
